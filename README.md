CircuitSim
==========

Aims to be a graphical frontend to creating circuits that can be simulated using JavaScript.
Design your circuit using drag-and-drop (via jQuery UI) and linking items together.

A plugin system allows for you to write your own objects and give them custom logic, rendering and actions.

For a look at the old text-only system, see the old_text subdirectory.
